Test for next.js init

## Purpose

This project is a test for initializing a next.js project. It starts with the default next.js initialization with npx create-next-app. Next, typescript and tailwindcss are initialized separately. This is intended as a demonstration for setting up next.js with default parameters and adding typescript and tailwindcss after.
